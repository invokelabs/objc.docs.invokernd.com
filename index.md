This style guide outlines the coding conventions for Objective-C at Invoke Labs. 

This guide is forked from the [NYTimes Objective-C Style Guide](https://github.com/NYTimes/objetive-c-style-guide/).

As this document is always evolving, we welcome your feedback via [pull requests](https://bitbucket.org/invokelabs/invoke-objective-c-style-guide/pull-requests), and [emails](mailto:dev.ios@invokelabs.com).

# Introduction

Here are some of the documents from Apple that informed the style guide. If something isn't mentioned here, it's probably covered in great detail in one of these:

* [The Objective-C Programming Language](http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjectiveC/Introduction/introObjectiveC.html)
* [Cocoa Fundamentals Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaFundamentals/Introduction/Introduction.html)
* [Coding Guidelines for Cocoa](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/CodingGuidelines.html)
* [iOS App Programming Guide](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/iphone/conceptual/iphoneosprogrammingguide/Introduction/Introduction.html)

If there is a conflict between something defined in this guide, and Apple's documentation then this document should be taken as correct.
