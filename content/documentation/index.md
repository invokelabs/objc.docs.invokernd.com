Documentation should confrom to the [AppleDoc](https://github.com/tomaz/appledoc) format. If possible, all public interfaces should be documented.

# Comments

When they are needed, comments should be used to explain **why** a particular piece of code does something. Any comments that are used must be kept up-to-date or deleted.

Block comments should generally be avoided, as code should be as self-documenting as possible, with only the need for intermittent, few-line explanations. This does not apply to those comments used to generate documentation.
